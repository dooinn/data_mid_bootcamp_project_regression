## Project Objective
This project is focused on comprehending the influential factors driving real estate prices, and utilizing Machine Learning algorithms for price prediction. Part of the Ironhack Mid-term Bootcamp, our project delves into a dataset of 22,000 properties transacted between May 2014 and May 2015 in King County, WA.

## Dataset
Our data exhibits various house attributes, such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, home and lot square footage, view, condition, grade, year built and renovated, zip code, latitude and longitude coordinates, and of course, the price.

## Tools Employed
- **Visualization**: Tableau
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: MySQL, Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Machine Learning**: Python (Jupyter Notebook) utilizing Linear Regression, KNN Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor

## Project Structure:

1. **Import Libraries & Load Dataset**: Initialization of the data exploration and analysis journey.
2. **Dataset Overview**: A quick look into the data attributes.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring data quality and integrity.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Delving deeper into the data to reveal insights.
5. **Data Modeling**: Building models via Linear Regression, KNN Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Rigorous cross-examination of the developed models.
7. **Feature Importance Analysis**: Determining key price influencers.
8. **Conclusio**n: Summarizing findings and recommending future work.


## Conclusion
- The RandomForestRegressor emerged as the top-performing model across various data preprocessing techniques such as standard scaling and log transformation.

- Features like grade, lat, and sqft_living were found to significantly influence the price, with the grade reflecting the house's quality, lat representing the location, and sqft_living indicating the house size.

- It is recommended to consider additional social factors like transportation, education, and crime rates for a more comprehensive price prediction.
